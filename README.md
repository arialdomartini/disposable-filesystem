Disposable FileSystem
=====================
A C# library to help creating temporary files and directories in tests projects

## Building from source code
### Build
Run:

```
dotnet build
```

### Run tests
Run:

```bash
dotnet test DisposableFileSystemTest/DisposableFileSystemTest.csproj
```

It should be possible to run tests with a simpler `dotnet test`, but I run in the issue ['dotnet test' in solution folder fails when non-test projects are in the solution #1129](http://wiki.c2.com/?DisposableFileSystem)
